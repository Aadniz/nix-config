# This metaconfig.toml file dictates what config Pinnacle will run.
#
# When running Pinnacle, the compositor will look in the following directories for a metaconfig.toml file,
# in order from top to bottom:
#     $PINNACLE_CONFIG_DIR
#     $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pinnacle/
#     ~/.config/pinnacle/
#
# When Pinnacle finds a metaconfig.toml file, it will execute the command provided to `command`.
# To use a Rust config, this should be changed to something like ["cargo", "run"].
#
# Because configuration is done using an external process, if it ever crashes, you lose all of your keybinds.
# The compositor will load the default config if that happens, but in the event that you don't have
# the necessary dependencies for it to run, you may get softlocked.
# In order prevent you from getting stuck in the compositor, you must define keybinds to reload your config
# and kill Pinnacle.
#
# More details on each setting can be found below.

# The command Pinnacle will run on startup and when you reload your config.
# Paths are relative to the directory the metaconfig.toml file is in.
# This must be an array.
command = ["cargo", "run", "--release"]

### Keybinds ###
# Each keybind takes in a table with two fields: `modifiers` and `key`.
# - `modifiers` can be one of "Ctrl", "Alt", "Shift", or "Super".
# - `key` can be a string of any lowercase letter, number,
#   "numN" where N is a number for numpad keys, or "esc"/"escape".
# Support for any xkbcommon key is planned for a future update.

# The keybind that will reload your config.
reload_keybind = { modifiers = ["Ctrl", "Alt"], key = "r" }
# The keybind that will kill Pinnacle.
kill_keybind = { modifiers = ["Ctrl", "Alt"], key = "escape" }

### Socket directory ###
# Pinnacle will open a Unix socket at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` by default, falling back to `/tmp` if it doesn't exist.
# If you want/need to change this, use the `socket_dir` setting set to the directory of your choosing.
#
# socket_dir = "/your/dir/here/"

### Environment Variables ###
# If you need to spawn your config with any environment variables, list them here.
[envs]
# key = "value"
